## Portfolio Management in Finance
Portfolio management in finance involves the strategic management of a collection of financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, and other securities, with the goal of achieving specific investment objectives. 
The process includes selecting appropriate assets, determining the allocation of funds among them, and regularly monitoring and adjusting the portfolio to optimize returns while managing risk. 
Portfolio management aims to create a well-balanced and diversified investment portfolio that aligns with an investor's financial goals and risk tolerance. 
It often involves analysis, forecasting, and the use of various financial models and strategies to make informed investment decisions.
